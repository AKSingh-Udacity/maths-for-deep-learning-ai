## Just what is artificial intelligence?

Artificial intelligence is harder to describe in finite terms than it is to recreate many of the most popular algorithms that serve to represent it. 

>The definition, if we can say that such a thing exists, is a moving socio-cultural target and just as we get closer to it's said definition, it again, slips a little bit further.

This is partly because AI has always been fundamentally tied up with some of our deepest philosophical queries and as we make further progress in AI and related sciences, we again are forced to redraw the line of what it means to be human.

> Nothing that we may know or learn about the functioning of the organism can give, without ‘microscopic,’ cytological work any clues regarding the further details of the neural mechanism.” - Von Neumann

Generation after generation, we've asked ourselves fundamental questions that AI, as a philosophical project, touches upon:

- What does it mean to be human? 
- What is the difference between humans and other animals?
- Is there another species that is more intelligent than we are (Übermensch)?
- Will humans be surpassed by a more intelligent species?

Neurobiologists like Sapolsky and others, have highlighted that many of the concepts we have held so dearly, empathy, politics, culture, tool usage, are not unique to the human species. It seems that are only true advantage may be in the sheer number of neurons (86 billion) and synaptic connections (100 trillion+) between them that has allowed for more elaborate and subtle ways of those concepts unfolding.

"We have the same nuts-and-bolts physiology, yet we're using it in very novel ways. - Robert Sapolsky"

While scientific discoveries continue to redraw the line of what is truly unique to humans, so does progress in artificial intelligence, the race to design more and more intelligent machines.


Rather than focus on the takeover, we will focus here on intelligence and it's the different forms it has taken over recorded history. 

I will split the term intelligence into three definitions that map roughly unto three intellectual projects, though not perfectly.
- Logic-based Intelligence as thinking correctly though logic and reasoning (propositional, Boolean algebra, and Jaynes probability theory)  [Explicit]
- Perception-based Intelligence as advanced intuition and pattern recognition (neural networks, perception, and statistical learning theory) [Implicit]
- Intelligence as embodied cognition (reinforcement learning)

We will primarily cover the first two subtypes of intelligence in this book and leave the reader to read more about embodied cognition. 


## Intelligence as logic and reasoning

Before we had anything like the first computer, Aristotle and others were already forming, what we call logic today, the foundations of the  which was primarily concerned with reasoning and thinking well. 

- what is thinking and reasoning? 
- what is it to think and reason well?
- can correct reasoning be mechanized?

> Perhaps there is a logic calculus than can mechanise reasoning

These are just some of questions that the likes of Aristotle, Leibniz, Turing, Laplace, Wittgenstein, Gödel, and Boole and others attempted to answer definitively. Aristotle and the Stoics gave us a framework for reasoning and propositional logic respectively. Leibniz gave us logical calculi and a glimpse int' computers that could do the same. We also have George Boole's Boolean algebra (1847) would catch up with Claude Shannon to begin the digital revolution and progress artificial intelligence.

Let us think about the context of such questions. 

The second set of questions were just as philosophically motivated, but differed in their approaches. Individuals from disciplines like biology, especially psychology, neurobiology, then called neurophysiology, began to see that the uniqueness of humans may be uncovered by emulating the brain directly. As we began to understand an infinitesimally small amount about how very basic elements called neurons (Pitts, McCulloch) give rise to basic intelligence in simpler species like fruitflies to the advanced intelligence to that of the great apes.

Pitts, McCulloch, Rosenblatt, Minsky, and others set out to combine the advances of logic, from Leibniz's logical calculi to Bool's Boolean algebra) and combine it with our growing knowledge in brain science which eventually lead to the creation of the first artificial neural network, named the perceptron. The first neural network which was based in the science of logic pushed forward by the likes of Leibniz and George Boole.



 they too had similar questions, "Can machines think?", "Can the brain be emulated?". These questions moved away from deductive reasoning and towards emulating our senses and pereptions. Rosenblatt, Hebb, Minsky, and others were able to move towards learning from data as humans do by recognising patterns which birthed the first neural network, the perceptron. 

This dichotomy, between symbolism and perception, like are dichotomies don't pin down the reality but we hope that it provides a way of thinking abbout our path towards today's artificial intelligence. We are now at a stage where we are bringing what we have learned in symbolic.

## Reasoning and Logic
Rene Descartes stated "Cogito, ergo sum" which translated means "I think therefore I am". He arrived at this statement after trying to use pure "reason" to find what was fundamentally true without any doubt. Although he couldn't complete his project, his value of "reason" was not unpopular and is gaining popularity in much of modern culture and can be heard in everyday conversations when we talk about the distinction between our thoughts and body. 

Reasoning starts with logic. 

Aristotle.

So let us begin with reasoning.

The branch and discipline titled logic was originally focused on finding absolute truths from statements that could be found in everyday discourse. Logic is fundamentally tied up with questions around how one can reason correctly. How one is able to deduce the correct answer given a set of statement or propositions.
