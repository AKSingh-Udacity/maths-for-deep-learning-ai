## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Philosophical Root

> Artificial Intelligence 

- Characteristica Universalis
+ all science could in principle be translated.
- Calculus ratiocinator 

*Alan Turing
- the father of computing, created a machine that can accept different instructions for different tasks in 1936 and marked the first step of the AI with his seminal 1950 paper. In the paper, he introduced the Turing test to determine whether a computer can be regarde intelligent. 

* Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence
- the conference was to 'proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be amde to simulate it.



> Logic

The journey towards deep learning continues with 2 classical 19th century works in Logic: 
1. John Stuart Mill's <System of Logic> from 1843 - **Logic psychologism**
+ where he illustrated the logic in terms of a manifestation of a mental process.

2. George Boole
- presented logic as a system of formal rules and it has reshaped the logic into a formal science. 


> Neural Network 

*Warren McCulloch was a phylosopher, psychologist and psychiatrist by degree, but he would work in neurophysiology and cybernetics. 

He and Walter Pitts published a paper titled "[A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/Class/10715/reading/McCulloch.and.Pitts.pdf)"
