<p>Some <em>significant</em> applications are demonstrated in this chapter.</p>

<div id="what-is-it-to-think" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> What is it to think?</h2>
<p>Artificial intelligence is harder to describe in finite terms than it is to recreate many of the popular algorithms that serve to represent it. This is because AI has always been fundamentally tied up with some of our species deepest philosophical queries, possibly more than any other discipline.</p>
<p>We ask ourselves many questions such as:</p>
<p>What does it mean to be human? What makes us different or similar? What is the difference between humans and other animals? Is there another species that is more intelligent than we are (Übermensch)? Will humans be surpassed by a more intelligent species?</p>
<p>The question as to whether these questions are valid or not is beyond the scope of this book, but the questions themselves do provide us with a view into the history of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is by nature, multidisciplinary; logicians, mathematicians, neuroscientists, theologians, philosophers, computer scientists, statisticians, ethicists, roboticist, cognitive psychologists, ethnologists, are just a few of the titles of those who have made AI what it is today.</p>
<p>The design of intelligent machines has always been serious business. For many the question starts with “what is thinking and reasoning? What is it to think and reason well?” and even before the invention of computers there were questions such as “Can correct reasoning be mechanised?”. These are just some of questions that the likes of Aristotle, Leibienitz, Turing, Laplace, Wittengenstein, Godel, and Boole attempted to answer definitively. The second set of questions were just as philosophically motivated, but instead from different disiplines like biology, espeically neurobiology, then called neurophysiology which took on different questions. As we began to understand an infinitesimal amount about how very basic elements called neurons can give rise to thinking and intelligence, they too had similar questions, “Can machines think?”, “Can the brain be emulated?”. These questions moved away from deductive reasoning and towards emulating our senses and pereptions. Rosenblatt, Hebb, Minsky, and others were able to move towards learning from data as humans do by recognising patterns which birthed the first neural network, the perceptron.</p>
<p>This dichotomy, between symbolism and perception, like are dichotomies don’t pin down the reality but we hope that it provides a way of thinking abbout our path towards today’s artificial intelligence. We are now at a stage where we are bringing what we have learned in symbolic.</p>

<div id="reasoning-and-logic" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Reasoning and Logic</h2>
<p>Rene Descartes stated “Cogito, ergo sum” which translated means “I think therefore I am”. He arrived at this statement after trying to use pure “reason” to find what was fundamentally true without any doubt. Although he couldn’t complete his project, his value of “reason” was not unpopular and is gaining popularity in much of modern culture and can be heard in everyday conversations when we talk about the distinction between our thoughts and body.</p>
<p>Reasoning starts with logic.</p>
<p>Aristotle.</p>
<p>So let us begin with reasoning.</p>
<p>The branch and discipline titled logic was originally focused on finding absolute truths from statements that could be found in everyday discourse. Logic is fundamentally tied up with questions around how one can reason correctly. How one is able to deduce the correct answer given a set of statement or propositions.</p>
<p>What is the connection between logic and AI in history and maths? Difference between propositional logic and symbolic logic Where do we use logic in deep learning Where does boolean logic end up ? In designing circuits</p>
<p>From propositional logic to boolean algebra From Aristotle to George Boole to Claude Shannon</p>
<p>Books Mathematical for Analysis of Logic An Investigation of the Laws of Thought</p>
<p>Propositions can be TRUE or FALSE Propositions can be compounded</p>
