Why do we exist? Many have tired to approach this question with varying degrees of illumination. It also fuels us to continuously push the boundry of science to uncover the truth of the world and ourselves. But there are still more questions than there are answers. Artificial intelligence has become a salient mirror just as the industrial revolution made us realise what type of work “humans” can do and should be doing, and therefore illuminates what we valued as humans. We moved away from the endlessness of the question of why are we here and immediately moved to what Bourdieu called Distinction. What makes us different? Of all the sciences that have begin to answer the question, progress in the field of philosophy, neurobiology, computer science, artificial intelligence, primatology, anthropology, and sociology have all played a role in thinning the line between us and others i.e. animals just as Netwonian physics have told us that we may not be alone, that we may not be the centre of the universe. Monkeys with tools, dolphins and casual sex, elephans and their endless memory, and the bees way of social organising shortened our view of humans as distinct. But as Ernest Becker has said, we are half animal and half symbolic and so we find ourselves valuing what is seems more abstract and less grounded in the flesh. However, despite the complexity of the issue, it never discourages us from seeking the truth. 5.1.1 Philosophy Descarte and Aristole came to similar conclusion about the question. What makes us human is our ability to reason, to detached ourselves from our feelings and to rationalize. As Aristotle said,the essence of a man is to know and to desire to know. Man, by his rational intellect, is meant to seek truth and to understand the reality in which he exists. Our intellect also endows us the ability to manipulate symbols i.e. language. Our language and memory allow us to create and maintain the culture from one generation to another. It certainly discriminate us from other species. However, it does not fully solve our problems. We are certainly more than just our intellect. More precisely, some scientists may argue intellect could be considered as one crutial element of the ‘Mind’. Alongside intellect, we also have our human ‘will’ which illumates our ability to choose and to act. They work parallely to support our decision making. We use our ability to reason, to distinguish right from wrong, and to quickly adapt our behavior in a novel environment. We could be considered as one of most adaptive and flexible animals on earth. 5.1.2 Neurobiology But what is mind? We will in parallel other scientists looked to Darwin and a more biological view of intelligence. As the studies on the nervous system became more and more advances, we moved from psychological theory grounded in observational research to looking at networks of neurons and how they react to certain stimulus. This leads to neuroscience which was slowly unearthing the mechanism and the power of our central nervous system, the key to our most profound features i.e. our cognition, thinking, reasoning, perceiving, emotion/feelings, and learning and memory. This would eventually lead to the cognitive revolution where the scientists from different fields came to study the brain and mental activitiy happening in ourselves and other animals. It is obvious now, that this would lead to a want to emulate the central nervous system and possibly cultivate intelligence from there. 5.1.3 The rise of Artificial Intelligence Can we emulate the brain and would that then give us keys to intelligence? Could that give us the answer to conciousness? AI seemed as an adaquate approach to answer such questions. We still only know very little about how we reason, learn, and experience everyday life. By applying and experimenting our learning with AI, we harvest a swifter progress towards the truth of intelligence. At the current consilience point of the history, we can see AI as two tracks, applied AI, and philosophical AI. The former deals with cerating industrial applications to benefit us and the latter is around understanding and breeding intelligence. It now becomes clear for us that AI is both a tool and a mirror. The hype will always exist because we do not know what makes us human and what we can and cannot emulate. AI has a chance at being a tool we can use to make the world better or worse, and it also gives us a mirror into ourselves, the mystery of intelligence and what it means to exist. 5.2 Thinking and Reasoning 5.2.1 Logic 5.2.2 Probability 5.2.3 Symbolic AI &amp; Expert Systems 5.3 Neurobiology &amp; Learning 5.3.1 Learning Theory 5.3.2 Behaviourism and Reinforcement Learning 5.3.3 Artificial Neurons 5.3.4 Cognitive Revolution 5.4 AGI and it’s discontents 5.4.1 Definitions 5.4.2 Safety &amp; Ethics 5.4.3 Consilience 5.4.4 Pursuits 5.5 Applied AI 5.5.1 Cars 5.5.2 Robots 5.5.3 Voice Assistants 5.5.4 Recommended 5.6 Conclusion 5.6.1 What makes us human? 5.6.2 Opportunities "]
