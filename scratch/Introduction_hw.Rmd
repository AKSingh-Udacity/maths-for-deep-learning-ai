# Intro 
## What Makes us Human

As Aristotle said, the essence of a man is to know and to desire to know. Man, by his rational intellect, is meant to seek truth and to understand the reality in which he exists. Aristotle regards our intellect as the way to define human. It seems like a very appealing definition. But is that all what makes us human?

Some may argue, humans have mind. Mind consists of intellect and will. In a sense, the intellect is knowledge and the will is active choice. We human have mind and our free will to choose. You may also argue, we are special because our ability to create and to malnipulate symbols i.e. language. Our language and memory allow us to create and maintain the culture from one generation to another and this is what meant to be a human. 

Moreover, some may also consider the fact that we are distinguished by our awareness of our own death. 

You are all right. All of these make us what we are - a human being. 

Some may argue, humans have mind. Mind consists of intellect and will. In a sense, the intellect is knowledge and the will is active choice. We human have mind and our free will to choose. In other words, we human seems to have the ability to distinguish right from wrong and we have an adequate mental model that helps us navigate through the world and support our decision making. We are consitent learning and interacting with the external world which consintuous help us to be better adaptive to the world. 

You may also argue, we are special because our ability to create and to malnipulate symbols i.e. language. Our language and memory allow us to create and maintain the culture from one generation to another and this is what meant to be a human. It could go back to the neurobiology root of human brain. We human have sophisicated brain and mind.  


# Thinking and Reasoning 
## Logic 
Logic and AI has a long and interwined history. As the one of the first steps we human took to uncover the truth of being a human, many scientists especially logicians have came to the same conclution that what makes human unique is our ability to think and reason. Logic was developed as the main tool to support this goal. 

[Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle) (384-322 BCE), as one of the first pioneers in developing the subject of logic, he set out to conduct the formal study of what is now known as 'formal logic'. His logic was concerned with the form, and not the content of statements or propositions. Basically, Aristotle's system of logic introduced "hypothetical syllogism", "temporal model logic" and "inductive logic".

Followed his footstep, Rene Descartes also came up with the best-known quotations in philosophy:"Cogito, ergo sum" ("I think, therefore I am"). Besides being a 'rational' philosopher, his contribution to mathematics was also of the first order, he is the inventor of Cartesian coordinate system and the founder of analytics geometry which has laid the foundation of the later developed calculus and mathematical analysis.

[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz) (1646-1716), along with Rene Descartes, was a major figure in the Continental Rationalism movement. His contributions to logic were perhaps the most important between Aristotle and the later extended model symbolic logic. As the inventor of calculus, and as the discoverer of the binary system. He suggested that a universal calculus of reasoning could be devised which would provide an automatic method of solution for all problems which could be expressed in the universal language.


Symbolic logic was not fully developed until the invention of Boolean Algebra. As the inventor of the Boolean Algebra, [George Boole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole) (1815-1864) is also a philosopher and logician who proposed that:
> No general method for the solution of questions in the theory of probabilities can be established which does not explicitly recognise, not only the special numerical bases of the science, but also those universal laws of thought which are the basis of all reasoning, and which, whatever they may be as to their essence, are at least mathematical as to their form.

After George Boole, plenty of other well-known logician and mathematicians joined the force to push the development of logic and helped to establish the unshakable status of logic as one of the most important properties of human. 


[Gottlob Frege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege) (1848-1925) discovered predicate logic. He is well-acknowledged by many to be the father of analytic philosophy, concentrating on the philosophy of language and mathematics. His work was later brought to the center of the attention by Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932) and Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) and served as the beginning point for an enormous outpouring of work in formal logic. 

As the inventor of Turing machine and famous Turing test, [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. The Turing machine that he designed is a mathematical model of computation which is capable of simulating that algorithm's logic can be constructed.

All of those people have brought logic to life and step by step helped the invention of the early computer and the birth of AI. 

It is undeniable that logic is still one of the most well-accepted element of human intelligence broadly and the reason that makes human unique.

## Probability 

Logic, as the proxy to human reasoning and thinking, itself is not complete and it also has its extension that plays an crucial role in our daily reasoning - Probabilistic Reasoning/Logic. 

By definition, probabilistic reasoning is to combine the capacity of probability theory to handle uncertainty with the capacity of deductive logic to exploit structure of formal argument. Probability theory itself as the branch of mathematics could be considered as the tool that helps us reason under uncertainty. 

Jacob Bernoulli is one of the founders of calculus of variations. However, his most important contribution was in the field of probability, where he derived the first version of the *law of large numbers*  in his work Ars Conjectandi.


Thomas Bayes, as one of most well-known pioneers in developing probability theory, is known for formulating a specific caseof the theorem that bears his name: Bayes' Theorem. However, Bayes himself may not have embraced the broad interpretation now called Bayesian, which was in fact pioneered and popularized by Pierre-Simon Laplace.
