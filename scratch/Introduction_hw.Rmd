# Intro 
## What Makes us Human

As Aristotle said, the essence of a man is to know and to desire to know. Man, by his rational intellect, is meant to seek truth and to understand the reality in which he exists. Aristotle regards our intellect as the way to define human. It seems like a very appealing definition. But is that all what makes us human?

Some may argue, humans have mind. Mind consists of intellect and will. In a sense, the intellect is knowledge and the will is active choice. We human have mind and our free will to choose. You may also argue, we are special because our ability to create and to malnipulate symbols i.e. language. Our language and memory allow us to create and maintain the culture from one generation to another and this is what meant to be a human. 

Moreover, some may also consider the fact that we are distinguished by our awareness of our own death. 

You are all right. All of these make us what we are - a human being.

Some may argue, humans have mind. Mind consists of intellect and will. In a sense, the intellect is knowledge and the will is active choice. We human have mind and our free will to choose. In other words, we human seems to have the ability to distinguish right from wrong and we have an adequate mental model that helps us navigate through the world and support our decision making. We are consitent learning and interacting with the external world which consintuous help us to be better adaptive to the world. 

You may also argue, we are special because our ability to create and to malnipulate symbols i.e. language. Our language and memory allow us to create and maintain the culture from one generation to another and this is what meant to be a human. It could go back to the neurobiology root of human brain. We human have sophisicated brain and mind.  


# Thinking and Reasoning 
## Logic 
Logic and AI has a long and interwined history. As the one of the first steps we human took to uncover the truth of being a human, many scientists especially logicians have came to the same conclution that what makes human unique is our ability to think and reason. Logic was developed as the main tool to support this goal. 

Dating back to 300 BC, their were major figures across many the field of philosophy, sociology, economics, and mathematics have looked to reasoning as one of the key distinctions of humankind. Our ability to take a set of propositions and to know their truth and false values. Only from this base of propositions can we begin to conclude or make logical combinations to create valid knowledge.

[Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle) (384-322 BCE), as one of the first pioneers in developing the subject of logic, he set out to conduct the formal study of what is now known as 'formal logic'. He called humans "animal rationale", in his treatise, 

%On the Soul,  who saw humans as distinguised by their rationality, proposed the syllogism; Which was one of the first formulations of logic around 300 B.C. found in the Organon.

 In 1275, Ramon Llull, a spanish Theologian wrote the Ars Magna (Art of Finding Truth), which provided a method based in logic to produce new knowledge.

Followed their footstep, Rene Descartes also came up with one of the best-known quotations in philosophy:"Cogito, ergo sum" ("I think, therefore I am"). Besides being a 'rational' philosopher, his contribution to mathematics was also of the first order, he is the inventor of Cartesian coordinate system and the founder of analytics geometry which has laid the foundation of the later developed calculus and mathematical analysis.=

[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz) (1646-1716), along with Rene Descartes, was a major figure in the Continental Rationalism movement. His contributions to logic were perhaps the most important between Aristotle and the later extended model symbolic logic. As the inventor of calculus, and as the discoverer of the binary system. He suggested that a universal calculus of reasoning could be devised which would provide an automatic method of solution for all problems which could be expressinged in the universal language.

Symbolic logic was not fully developed until the invention of Boolean Algebra. As the inventor of the Boolean Algebra, [George Boole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole) (1815-1864) is also a philosopher and logician who proposed that:
> No general method for the solution of questions in the theory of probabilities can be established which does not explicitly recognise, not only the special numerical bases of the science, but also those universal laws of thought which are the basis of all reasoning, and which, whatever they may be as to their essence, are at least mathematical as to their form.

After George Boole, plenty of other well-known logician and mathematicians joined the force to push the development of logic and helped to establish the unshakable status of logic as one of the most important properties of human.

[Gottlob Frege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege) (1848-1925) %discovered predicate logic. He is well-acknowledged by many to be the father of analytic philosophy, concentrating on the philosophy of language and mathematics. His work was later brought to the center of the attention by Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932) and Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) and served as the beginning point for an enormous outpouring of work in formal logic. 

As the inventor of Turing machine and famous Turing test, [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. The Turing machine that he designed is a mathematical model of computation which is capable of simulating that algorithm's logic can be constructed.

Claude Shannon (1916-2001) is noted for having founded information theory with a landmark paper, A Mathematical Theory of Communication, that he published in 1948. He is, perhaps, equally well known for founding digital circuit design theory in 1937, when—as a 21-year-old master's degree student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)—he wrote his thesis demonstrating that electrical applications of Boolean algebra could construct any logical numerical relationship

All of those people have brought logic to life and step by step helped the invention of the early computer and the birth of AI. 

## Reason Under Uncertainty 

Although logic gave us a way to reason under specific conditions, those conditions didn't match the real world. As we wonder about the world we often don't have enough information to make absolutely correct decisions.

Logic, as the proxy to human reasoning and thinking, itself is not complete and it also has its extension that plays an crucial role in our daily reasoning - Probabilistic Reasoning/Logic. 

> The true logic of this world is to be found in theory of probability.
- James Clark Maxwell

By definition, probabilistic reasoning is to combine the capacity of probability theory to handle uncertainty with the capacity of deductive logic to exploit structure of formal argument. Probability theory itself as the branch of mathematics could be considered as the tool that helps us reason under uncertainty. 

Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) in his book Pensées used a probabilistic argument, Pascal's Wager, to justify belief in God and a virtuous life. The work done by Fermat and Pascal into the calculus of probabilities laid important groundwork for Leibniz' formulation of the calculus. Besides that, he also started some pioneering work on calculating machines when was still a teenager in 1642. After 3 years of effoft and 50 prototypes, he built 20 finished machines called Pascal's calculators, eastablishing him as one of the first 2 inventors ofthe machanical calculator.

Together with René Descartes, Pierre de Fermat (1607-1665) was one of the two leading mathematicians of the first half of the 17th century. Through their correspondence in 1654, Fermat and Blaise Pascal helped lay the foundation for the theory of probability. From this brief but productive collaboration on the problem of points, they are now b0iarded as joint founders of probability theory. In his ethodus ad disquirendam maximam et minimam and in De tangentibus linearum curvarum, Fermat developed a method (adequality) for determining maxima, minima, and tangents to various curves that was equivalent to differential calculus.

Jacob Bernoulli (1654-1705) is one of the founders of calculus of variations. However, his most important contribution was in the field of probability, where he derived the first version of the *law of large numbers*  in his work Ars Conjectandi. James Bernoulli proved that the frequency method and the classical method are consistent with one another in his book Ars Conjectandi in 1713.

De Moivre (1667-1754)provided many tools to make the classical method more useful, including the multiplication rule, in his book The Doctrine of Chances in 1718 which is said to have been prized by gamblers. De Moivre first discovered Binet's formula, the closed-form expression for Fibonacci numbers linking the nth power of the golden ratio φ to the nth Fibonacci number. He also was the first to postulate the central limit theorem, a cornerstone of probability theory.

Thomas Bayes (1701-1761), as one of most well-known pioneers in developing probability theory, is known for formulating a specific caseof the theorem that bears his name: Bayes' Theorem. However, Bayes himself may not have embraced the broad interpretation now called Bayesian, which was in fact pioneered and popularized by Pierre-Simon Laplace. 

As mentioned earlier, the Bayesian interpretation of probability was developed mainly by Laplace. Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749-1827) presented a mathematical theory of probability with an emphasis on scientific applications in his 1812 book Theorie Analytique des Probabilities.  

Andrey Kolmogorov (1903-1987) developed the first rigorous approach to probability in his 1933 monograph Grundbegriffe der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnun. His pioneering work, About the Analytical Methods of Probability Theory, was published (in German) in 1931. In 1933, Kolmogorov published his book, Foundations of the Theory of Probability, laying the modern axiomatic foundations of probability theory and establishing his reputation as the world's leading expert in this field. 

Ludwig Boltzmann (1844-1906)

Josiah Willard Gibbs (1839-1903)

Ronald Fisher

ET Jaynes (1922-1998) wrote extensively on statistical mechanics and on foundations of probability and statistical inference, initiating in 1957 the maximum entropy interpretation of thermodynamics as being a particular application of more general Bayesian/information theory techniques. Jaynes strongly promoted the interpretation of probability theory as an extension of logic. His posthumous book, Probability Theory: The Logic of Science (2003) gathers various threads of modern thinking about Bayesian probability and statistical inference, develops the notion of probability theory as extended logic, and contrasts the advantages of Bayesian techniques with the results of other approaches. 


Judea Pearl (1936-) is best known for championing the probabilistic approach to artificial intelligence and the development of Bayesian networks. He is the 2011 winner of the ACM Turing Award, the highest distinction in computer science, "for fundamental contributions to artificial intelligence through the development of a calculus for probabilistic and causal reasoning".
