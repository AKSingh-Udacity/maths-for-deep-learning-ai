The start of AI could really trace back to the very start of our human species from the time we start to wonder who we are and what it means to be a human. One of the first answer we came up with is our ability to think and reason. Back to the age of Aristotle who established a framework later called logic, to the recent symbolic AI are all our attempts to understand and capture our intelligence using logic considered as one of our most special properties. However, in the last century, as we discovered more and more about ourselves biologically especially neurobiologically, it bought us to rethink the answer. Instead of thinking of who we are, we started to focus more on what we are made of and how we learn and perceive. This thinking brought a whole paradigm shift in AI history. We are not merely a reasoning machine, we are human and we have sophisticated brain, mind and ability to experience and momerize and perhaps these account for our intelligence. More recently, many of those views started to converge. We started to realize that no single element can outweight the others and be regarded as the main or the only reason that makes us unique. But rather, all those elements from the ability to sense, to reason, to feel angry or even to make a moral judgement together should be all considered as intelligent. In this sense, we are in the age of approaching artificial general intelligence. sss
