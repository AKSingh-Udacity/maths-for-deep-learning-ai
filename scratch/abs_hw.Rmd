The start of AI could really trace back to the every start of our human species from the time we start to wonder who we are and what it means to be a human. One of the first answer we came up with is our ability of thinking and reasoning. Back to the age of Aristotle who established a framework with syllogism, we later call it logic, to the recent symbolic AI are all our attempt to regard logic as one of our most special properties. However, in the last century, as we found more and more about ourselves biologically and neuroscientifically, it bought us to rethink the answer. Instead of thinking of who we are, we started to focus more on what we are made of and how to learn and exist in the world. This thinking brought a whole paradigm shift in AI history. We are not merely a reasoning machine, we are human and we have sophisticated brain, mind and ability to sense an experience and this might be the keys that we are intelligent. More recently, we started to realize that no single piece can account for the reason that makes us unique, instead, all those elements from the ability to sense to the ability to do abstract reasoning and even to make a moral judgement together
