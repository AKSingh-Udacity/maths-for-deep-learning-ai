1. What are we humans (are we unique and why)? --> we are different because we are intelligent


2. How and why we are intelligent? --> we can reason/think/learn and have consciousness/mind 


3. What is intelligence? --> the ability to reason/think/learn 


4. Can machines think (like us)? --> mechanize human's ability to reason/think/learn 


The history of AI:
Start from the initial attempt made by Aristotle uses syllogism and later logic to reason to tell right from wrong. They believe that reason and logic is the key to help us think and makes us intelligent. On the other hand, people consistently try to mechanize the thinking and reasoning process. By combining both, we develop better and better theories(in symbolic reasoning and neuroscience) and machines to mechanize this process until the point we start to believe it is possible to make a machine tat thinks like human given the right guidance. The start of AI. There are other scientists who find out why we humans are different > because our ability to sense and some even believe that knowledge is in the world and we are just learning from there which leads us to explore the possibilities. We have robots with bodies. The current development of deep learning make machines an perception/pattern matching experts that can learn from the data. The next step, consciousness?



Missing:
- the next step is to approach AGI (artificial intelligence). If computers beat humans in every perception task they won't have reached AGI if we define general intelligence as we do below  
- who were the groups of people? were they mostly mathematicians by title? when did the neuroscientists come in?
- You suggest that intelligence shifted from logic to perception but I think we should mount this into a shift that consider perception as a major component of intelligence. More than people could have imagined.


The Neurobiological View of Intelligence
As it turns out, the neuroscience around intelligent is neither precisely defined our well agreed upon. But what has been clear is that intelligence doesn't fit nicely into any of the categorical buckets 

Intelligence is now, or always has been, multi-facetd and the grand theory of deep learning will eventually find it's place beneath the hype, not as intelligence but as a necessary component of it; just as logic and higher-order reasoning.


If one may define general intelligence it is within these abilities
- Pattern Recognition - The learning problem
- Reasoning - model the world and relations between objects and concepts logically
- Build adaptive mental models of the world
- Small n learning (learning from a small number of observations )
- Plan and apply knowledge flexibly 
- Flexibility of Knowledge

THEMES

- Logical Positivism: a statement is meaningful only if it is either purely formal (mathematics and logic) or capable of empirical verification. Rejection of metaphysics on the grounds that it is unverificable. It implies that all scientific propositions can be expressed, usually by means of various 'reduction' or explications' of the terms of the science to the terms of another more fundamental one. 


- Metaphysics: the nature of existence, being and the world. Foundation of philosophy (Aristotle calls 'first philosophy or just 'wisdom'), says it is the subject that deals with 'first causes' and the principles of things'.
Aristotle originally split metaphysics into 3 main sections: 

+ Ontology: the study of being and existence, including the definition and classification of entities, physical or mental, the nature of their properties, and the nature of change.

+ Natural Theology: the study of God, including the nature of religion and the world, exisence of divine, questions about the screation, and the various other religious or spiritual issues.

+ Universal Science: the study of first principles of logic and reasoning, such as the law of noncontradiction. 

In sum, it implies an idea about the world or the universe, which may seem reasonable but it is ultimately not empirically verificable, testable or provable.


- Materialism: all things are composed of material and the only thing can be truly proven to exist is matter --> mind-body problem --> robot needs a body to learn from the world 


- Phenomenology: study of experience and how we experience.
